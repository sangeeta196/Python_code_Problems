Problem1: Write a program in Python to prompt the user to input their name, employee number, week ending date, hours worked, rate per hour, standard and overtime tax percentage rate. Use the 
data input to calculate gross pay, tax deductions and net pay. Output the results as a formatted payslip. Assume that a standard working week is 37.5 hours.


Problem2: Write a program in Python which prompts the user for their username in the format Domain Name\Username as per Figure 1a below.

Problem3: Write a program in Python that prompts the user to enter a number of integer values. The program stores the integers, counts the frequency of each integer and displays the frequency as per Figure 2 below.

Problem4: Implement the MYPY Phone Book System in Python as per Figure 3 below which allows users to add, delete, update and lookup phone numbers. The MYPY Phone Book System 
should store the individualâ€™s Full Name and Phone Number. Your program should not allow users to add the same number twice. On adding, deleting, updating or looking up a number, 
your program should let the user know if the operation was successful or not. On looking up a number return the full name and number of the individual; if the number is not found give 
the user the option to add the details they are looking up. The user can perform multiple actions; they can add a new entry and subsequently delete an entry without having to stop and start the program until they decide to quit.
